#Word Waterfall

###Word Waterfall is an experiment in realtime collaboration on the web.

Players collect words dropped from the top of their screen, letting words they don't find interesting fall to the bottom, and putting interesting words together to form phrases. 

Lone words fall quickly, but together, words gain buoyancy and eventually float to the top of the screen. 

Players are arranged into a "waterfall," with the top of one players screen representing the bottom of another, and vice versa. When a word drops past the bottom of a screen, it appears at the top of the screen of the player directly below. Conversely, when a group of words floats past the top of a screen, it appears at the bottom of another player's. 

The goal of this experiment is to create a free-form collaborative environment where users interact by suggesting interesting combinations of words. In this way, the most interesting phrases will make their way to the very top of the waterfall, where they appear globally on the site.
