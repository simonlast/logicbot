        <div class="header"> <a class="highlight" href="/">LogicBot</a> is a web-based logical programming environment.
        </div>
        <br /> <br />
        In most programming environments, there exists a dichotomy between the area where a user creates and edits a program, and the area where a user observes and manipulates its output. This dichotomy forces the user to form a mapping between them, understanding how a change in the program will alter its output.
        <br /><br />
        What if this dichotomy was removed? Is it possible to create a programming environment where a user creates and interacts with a program in the same place? LogicBot is an attempt to answer this question. Within the environment, the user places and connects buttons which act as elements of a logical circuit. Upon creating a circuit, the user can activate certain elements by touching them. When certain elements are activated, they exert force on the circuit, causing it to move. In this way, the user can program the circuit to move in interesting ways.
        <br /> <br />
        Can you make a circuit that moves constantly in a straight line? One that has controls to veer left and right? One that can move in every direction?
